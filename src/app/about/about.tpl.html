      My bio starts a bit early - at the age of 13, I was accepted into the Distance Learning Center's STEMPREP Project. Before entering high school, I spent a summer in Philadelphia taking college-level Biology, Chemistry, Statistics, and English (with a focus on research writing).

      My four high school summers were thus spent working on biomedical internships. Two summers were spent at Drexel University assisting with HIV research, one at the NIMH assisting with cancer and chromaffin cell research, and one at a private lab in Seattle assisting with yeast research.

      This led to a scholarship-funded education at Southern Methodist University, where I quickly changed paths and obtained two B.A.s in Geology and Creative Computing. These different fields led me to receive the Engaged Learning research grant for a project on earthquake data visualization.

      While doing all of this, I taught myself how to play the pipe organ, and became the first self-taught student to perform at the university's Meadows School of the Arts.

      Post-graduation, I began work with the USGS at the Cascades Volcano Observatory. Here, I build reliable web applications to handle volcanic data, and assist with geological work in the field.

      In my free time, I've been working on sewing, weightlifting, and building two digital pipe organs.
